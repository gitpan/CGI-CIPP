	- database configuration is given as a nice hash reference,

	- first internal version, mainly copied from Apache::CIPP
	  and modified to run without Apache. I replaced the
	  Apache request object with a object of CGI::CIPP
	  and reimplemented the needed Apache methods in the
	  CGI::CIPP class. This way I need not to change
	  CIPP.pm itself. It has no idea of where it works,
	  under CGI::CIPP or Apache::CIPP.
