0.07 joern
	- no caching of perl syntax errors

0.06  Sat Mar 18 2000 joern
	- all file operations use now flock() to prevent corrupt
	  cache files

0.05  Sun Feb 20 2000 joern
	- bugfix: internal redirects did not pass CGI parameters
	  correctly
	- bugfix: internal redirects did connect to a database again

0.04  Sun Oct 10 1999 joern
	- added some hints to the documentation about configuring
	  CGI::CIPP in combination with the Apache webserver

0.03  Sun Oct 3 1999 joern
	- simply forgotten to add README to MANIFEST, so the README
	  was not part of the dist file

0.02  Sat Oct 2 1999 joern
	- database configuration is given as a nice hash reference,
	  instead of the Apache style configuration parameters.
	  It's more Perl style than Apache style now :)

0.01  Fri Sep 11 1999 joern
	- first internal version, mainly copied from Apache::CIPP
	  and modified to run without Apache. I replaced the
	  Apache request object with a object of CGI::CIPP
	  and reimplemented the needed Apache methods in the
	  CGI::CIPP class. This way I need not to change
	  CIPP.pm itself. It has no idea of where it works,
	  under CGI::CIPP or Apache::CIPP.
